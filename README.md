## Project 1: Predicting trends in the price of gold bullion <br>
<br>
GitHub with project: https://github.com/peterartman/DataScience/tree/main/Project_1 <br>
<br>
<!-- **Introduction**
<br>
This project aims to determine price trends for gold bullion and create a machine learning model to predict these prices in the future.<br>
<br>
**Data sets and data sources**<br>
1. NASDAQ - price for gold bullion from London Bullion Market Association (LBMA/GOLD)<br>
<br>
**Infrastrucutre for data**
<br>
**APIs and libraries utilised**<br>
* [nasdaqdatalink](https://data.nasdaq.com)
<br>
**Work plan**
<br>
Work plan:<br>
              1. Download gold bullion prices from NASDAQ.    https://data.nasdaq.com          DONE<br>
              2. Download data from FRED                      https://fred.stlouisfed.org<br>             
              3. Download data from ECB                       https://data.ecb.europa.eu<br>
              4. Download data from OECD                      https://data.oecd.org<br>
              5. Download data from the EU.                       https://data.europa.eu/en<br>
              6. Download data from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange<br>
              7. Import downloaded data into memory<br>
                 and calculate the moving average and use it to predict the price of gold bullion.<br>
              8. Import remaining data into memory<br>
                 and use a random forest algorithm to improve predictions.<br>
                 <br>

<!-- ## Project 2: Analysis of Random Forest Algorithm and how to use this algorithm <br>
<br>
**Introduction**
<br>
This project aims to gather knowledge about Random Forest Algorithm <be>
<br>
**Work plan**
<br>
              1. Fork Jupyter notebook written by an industry expert. <br>
              2. Analyse the algorithm, used libraries and how it is used in the practical task(s).<br>
              3. Write notes in that Jupyter notebook for better memorisation.<br>
